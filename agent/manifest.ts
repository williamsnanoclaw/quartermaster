 * Everything this agent needs to exist, and how a human gets it.
 *
 * This drives onboarding. Add a setting here and `temper` will walk the next
 * person through finding it — so write `why` and `how` for someone who has
 * never seen the service before, not for yourself.
 *
 * Settings are only ever shown to the human. If the *agent* needs to know
 * something — that a folder is an Obsidian vault, that a key exists — say it in
 * NORTH_STAR.md too. Nothing here reaches the model.
